## What is SmartBox?

Say goodbye to porch pirates and missed delivery notices, and say hello to SmartBox! The SmartBox Delivery Service is an end-to-end system that allows independent couriers to easily and securely deliver your parcels and packages.

Here's how it works:

A delivery person scans your package through the SmartBox delivery app at a sorting facility and this will automatically reserve the nearest available SmartBox to you. When it comes time for the delivery, the package is placed inside the dedicated box, after which it will automatically close and lock up when the delivery person marks the item as delivered.

So how do you get your package out?üò± Start taking lessons on how to pick a lock or crack a safe? With the SmartBox app, you won't need to. üëç Customers can simply scan the SmartBox that contains their package and it will unlock and open for them to retrieve. Customers can also choose to subscribe to notifications through various channels, including smart assistants like Alexa!

## Why SmartBox?
Don't you just love it when your online order finally comes, only to have it sit at your front door unguarded while you're out and about enjoying life? I know we don't. SmartBox allows your package to be stored securely without the worry that someone might come and snatch your goodies. Better yet, you can forget about missed delivery notices since couriers can just leave your things in the box.

But wait, there's more! SmartBox isn't **_just_** a lock box, it's a complete solution from beginning to end. When your item is scanned at a sorting facility, the system will try to reserve the closest SmartBox to you. And if it can't, it helps the couriers save time and resources by avoiding the need to drive all the way to your empty home. Morever, it helps **you** save time too because you don't have to go all the way to the post office anymore just to pick up your fancy water flosser.
